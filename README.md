## Tasks
Develop a smart thermostat user interface to control cooling and heating. 
- When it is hot, the thermostat should run the air conditioner (AC) to cool
- When it is cold, it should run the heater to heat
- When it is within a comfortable temperature range, neither AC or heater should be on.
